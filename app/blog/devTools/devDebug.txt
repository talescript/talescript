I was playing around with the CSS animation to see how I could make an element move in a circular motion. Least to say I found the solution in a blog post. But, when I was looking into the performance of the animation (something I'm learning), I opened up the Firefox Dev tools and started to record the performance. Just to start familiarizing myself with it.

Looking into the call tree I noticed several strange js files getting called which was odd. There wasn't any Javascript code in my file.

I got my tin hat foil out and placed it on my head. Keep in mind that the picture you are looking at is after a reboot and is somewhat cleaner than what I had first seen, but it is quite close enough. I thought there was no way those Javascript files could show up, since my code was just this.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <title></title>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
            <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
        </head>
        <body>
            <header>
                <div class="square"></div>
            </header>
        </body>
    </html>

and for my **CSS**

    body {
        padding: 0;
        margin: 0;
    }
    
    header {
        height: 100vh;
        max-width: 30em;
        margin: 0 auto;
        background: #fff;
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
        justify-content: space-around;
        align-items: center;
    }
    
    .square {
        animation-name: xAxis;
        animation-duration: 3s;
        animation-iteration-count: infinite;
        animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.02, 0.01, 0.21, 1);
    }
    
    .square::after {
        content: '';
        display: block;
        width: 20px;
        height: 20px;
        border-radius: 20px;
        background-color: #000;
        animation: yAxis 3s infinite cubic-bezier(0.3, 0.27, 0.07, 1.64);
    }
    
    @keyframes xAxis {
      50% {
          animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.3, 0.27, 0.07, 1.64);
          transform: translateX(100px);
      }
    }
    
    @keyframes yAxis {
        50% {
            animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.02, 0.01, 0.21, 1);
            transform: translateY(-100px);
        }
      }

Let's begin with the troubleshooting. 

I opened another browser, which happened to be an older version of FIrefox as well. The Call Tree was the way it should be. No external sources being called.

All those calls to youtube seemed strange. Remember, the original output was a lot messier than the first picture and, I also entered some questionable websites yesterday, from a different partition trying to find somewhere to watch the game between Germany and England. My tin foil hat was firmly placed on the top of my head.

I asked myself what would happen if I open a new tab to youtube from the second browser?

![firefox dev tools with the JS calls][3]

All in all that didn't explain why it was happening on the first browser since none of my tabs were opened at Youtube. *Which for some odd reason pollutes all the other tabs with calls to home.*

But I did have one tab opened with embedded videos and it was the videos for this course :)
By navigating away to a page without the course videos, everything went back to normal. Well, besides keeping the FPS at a high rate for the CSS animation, which I still haven't figured out how to do.
