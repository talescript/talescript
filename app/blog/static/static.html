                <h1 class="title">Static Pages when nothing else will do.</h1>
                <p class="more-space">One of the issues with alternative solutions; that alternative being the likes of WordPress is the maintenance
                    involved. WordPress Core, in itself, is secure. The developers behind Wordpress do a very good job at
                    developing the product. But when you start installing Themes and plugins that are not part of the core
                    product and doing so without a proper plan, that is where a host of issues arise.</p>

                <h2>Static pages, not that other crap.</h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/wordpress-security-news-updates/statistics-70-percent-wordpress-installations-vulnerable/">
            70% of WordPress</a> installations are vulnerable to hacker attacks. But to be fair, everything is hackable.
                    If it exists, it can be hacked. But when you use a Static site, the attack surface reduces considerably.
                    There is no need to worry if a plugin becomes outdated. There is no need to worry about a security exploit
                    in your database. There is a production machine which simply serves the files to your end users.</p>

                <h2>Faster &dash; a class of its own.</h2>
                <p>Browsers render HTML, CSS and Javascript. That is it. Having a dynamic Web site means that each time someone
                    visits your web page, the server in charge of processing that request needs to build the resources for
                    every person that visits the page. A Static Site on the other hand always sends the same information,
                    reducing the need for computer resources.</p>

                <h2>Who is flexible?</h2>
                <p>When you use other solutions as WordPress, Drupal, et. al., they start out as a one&ndash;size&ndash;fits&ndash;all
                    solution. You later customize them by installing plugins. Too many plugins; go ahead and search for "must
                    have Wordpress plugins". You can use tools that help you create Static Sites, but I personally write
                    all the code from scratch. I like to view it as when Karl Marx came up with his theory. He first needed
                    to become an expert in Capitalism to be able to understand how that idea works.</p>

                <h2>Smaller Footprint</h2>
                <p>When building your website with Et. al., you can either host it yourself, making sure that everything is
                    kept up to date, avoiding any security vulnerabilities that show up every now and then; and would also
                    have to keep an eye out in case an updated plugin or theme breaks something.</p>

                <P>A Static site can be hosted anywhere. Remember that all in all, they are just text files with HTML, CSS and
                    Javascript code that is served to a browser. When we pair this with any number of services that do the
                    heavy lifting of serving your content, the time saved in maintenance can be spent in other aspects. Whether
                    it is in other areas of your business of using it to spend it with friends and family.</P>

                <h2>Realiable is crazy good</h2>
                <p>By not having a database in your static site, you don't have to worry about database errors. Just place your
                    static files in a content delivery network and they will be served using the server closest to your customer.
                    Obviously, nothing is 100% foolproof; but once again, it reduces the number of places where something
                    could go wrong.</p>

                <h2>Go far with Scalable</h2>
                <p>If all of a sudden your website has a spike in traffic, the server needs to do the same process to serve
                    each user. Every single page needs to be built by the server and sent. With Static sites, it's the same
                    content being served. There aren't any additional server resources being wasted; there aren't any additional
                    costs on that end. The only additional cost would be of increased bandwidth by some service providers.</p>

                <h2>All in all</h2>
                <p>At the end of the day, there is not a single solution which is superior to any other. As I mentioned earlier, 
                    WordPress Core and et. al. are solid products that have a number of great plugins. As long as the person that is implementing
                    your website can make informed decisions, beyond the marketing slogans regurgitated by a salesperson, you should be fine.
