        <article>

            <p>There is an assumption that Linux users tend to know what they are doing with their system, which is true to
                a certain degree. But when we start out, when we are beginners, there is only one possible outcome; we need
                to reinstall our OS. As we progress we lose that fear and end up writing blog posts about our experience
                in hopes it will serve someone, or even our future self from some headache. It also helps to get a better
                understanding of what we are doing.</p>

            <p>This post takes an answer found on Stack Exchange on how to install Python on Debian. But what the answer lacks
                as many other posts on any number of topics is an explanation from a beginners point of view. However, I
                do make the assumption that whoever is reading this feels comfortable working from the command line. That
                you are able to change directories, create files, update your system and so forth.</p>

            <p>For the impatient, the following is the answer found on Stack Exchange. But, as I researched the topic, I found
                a better way to build the dependencies which will be explained later on in this post.</p>

            <p>tl;dr</p>

            <h3>Preamble</h3>

            <p>Despite that the title focuses on Debian, the following concepts apply to Linux in general. Besides some differences
                which I'll mention (superficially) later on, you'll be able to find a link which will give the commands for
                yum and DNF based systems to build the python dependencies.</p>

            <p>If your system happens to be a fresh installation, chances are you don't have
                <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/sudo">sudo access</a>. </p>

            <p>
                There are a few ideas I believe should be mentioned before installing software that isn't part of the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">package manager</a>. Your first choice should always be to use your packet manager since they will automate
                the process in a consistent manner.
            </p>

            <p>But since we are here to learn, we may end up breaking stuff. It is a good idea to have a separate
                <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/amd64/apcs03.html.en">partition</a>
                for your home folder. The main reason is if something happens to corrupt the file system, or if we mess something up, generally
                only one partition is affected. Which means you would only need to replace that portion of the system. Or
                in our case, just delete the appropriate directories since we are going to specify where we are downloading
                and installing the software.</p>

            <p>Don't worry too much about it. As long as you have your data backed up, it is just a matter of reinstalling and/or
                copying the files back over. If we don't break stuff, how else are we going to learn? Do keep in mind I'm
                talking about your personal system and not a production server. But if you have no idea what I'm talking
                about: research, research, research!</p>

            <p>On the other hand, you could also use a
                <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SystemVirtualization">Virtual System</a> to experiment and play around with. If you happen to have the GNOME Desktop Environment,
                you can install
                <a href="https://packages.debian.org/jessie/gnome-boxes">gnome-boxes</a>. It is dead simple to use. A simple `sudo apt install gnome-boxes` to get the software. And
                no, I didn't forget the "-get" in the previous command. It is a different
                <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Apt">tool</a>
                that interacts with the packaging system.</p>

            <p>You should also know there is no need to install the latest version of Python, or any other software for that
                matter on your system. Even debian's wiki warns against suffering from the
                <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian#Don.27t_suffer_from_Shiny_New_Stuff_Syndrome">shiny new stuff syndrome.</a>
                Read the wiki and then come back. </p>

            <!-- <p>Seriously, read it. And don't worry, I use rel="noopener noreferrer". https://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/256-targetblank---the-most-underestimated-vulnerability-ever/
            </p> -->

            <p>The only reason you would need to install a new version of a given software, besides security updates, is if
                you need to use a feature that is only available in that software version. I remember this being another
                point of confusion when I started to learn programming. But in this case it serves as a learning experience.</p>

            <p>With the preamble over, we can start travelling down the rabbit hole.</p>

            <h3>Build environment</h3>

            <p>As I mentioned earlier, before we can compile the Python interpreter, we need to download some dependencies so
                our system can build the software. The answer on Stack exchange suggested the following dependencies needed
                to compile Python along with all their modules. If we keep searching, most answers contain a similar answer
                to the one found originally, which didn't make sense to me. I could not find one that explained how do you
                know which dependencies are needed?</p>

            <pre>
    <code>
    sudo apt-get install make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
    libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev \
    xz-utils tk-dev
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>This was a tricky part and finding the answer took quite some time. Actually I was unable to find a central place
                with a list of what is needed, but I did find a better way.</p>

            <p>The CPython interpreter only needs a C compiler to be built. But, some extension modules will need
                <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2358835/8828479">development headers</a> for additional libraries. From my limited understanding, what this means is that
                some of the modules
                <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html">(Python module index)</a> depend on C files necessary to compile the code. C is a lower level programming
                language.
            </p>

            <p>For example, the zlib python library for compression will need the zlib1g-dev to be able to be built and used.</p>

            <p>In my search for a solution I found Python's
                <a href=" https://devguide.python.org/setup/#build-dependencies">Developer Guide.</a>
                An unlikely place a beginner would end up, IMO. As stated in their guide, fortunately each distribution handles the heavy
                lifting for us. Instead of listing each dependency for download and installation, we can ask the distribution
                to build the dependency against a given Python version</p>

            <pre>
    <code>
    sudo apt-get build-dep python3.5
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>
                This command will handle finding, downloading and installing the dependencies needed to build python3.5. But if the given
                distribution you are using doesn't have python3.5 by default, the command will fail. As it was my case since
                I'm using Debian Jessie, which comes with Python3.4. Do not worry about the Python versions for now, I'll
                address them later and also the case if there happens to be a missing dependency.
            </p>

            <p>
                Obviously if you are on Debian Stretch, that command will run. But whatever python version your distribution comes with
                by default, just increase or decrease the python version. As it was my case, I ran
            </p>

            <pre>
    <code>
    sudo apt-get build-dep python3.4
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>
                Fortunately, when I finished building Python3.6, there weren't any dependencies missing. Tough, I would still like to be
                able to know explicitly which dependencies are needed before initiating the build process. That will probably
                come with experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Download</h3>

            <p>Once we have the build dependencies we can download python and uncompress the file. Find a location where you
                would like to uncompress it. Once that is done we move into the uncompressed directory. A key idea to remember
                is the
                <a href=" https://wiki.debian.org/FilesystemHierarchyStandard">File system Hierarchy</a>. It basically explains where things should go to maintain a certain semblance of
                order.
            </p>

            <p>Keep in mind that wget will download in the current working directory. If you open the terminal and you are in
                your home directory when you execute the command, the program will download in that directory. You can add
                the "-P" prefix to specify where to download it to.
                <code>`wget <file.txt> -P /path/to/folder`</code>, or manually change the directory where you would like the file to be downloaded.</p>

            <pre>
    <code>
    wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/Python-3.6.4.tar.xz
    tar xvf Python-3.6.4.tar.xz
    cd Python-3.6.4
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>
                We could install python in
                <code>$HOME/.local/</code>, which is merely a personal preference from - I can't recall where I picked it from - place. You can read
                more about it
                <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/264495">here</a>. But if you prefer to let the build script handle it, which we will, we could either call it without
                explicitly stating the location and the
                <code>`make altinstall`</code> will install python in
                <code>/usr/local/bin/</code> by default.
            </p>

            <pre>
    <code>
    ./configure --enable-optimizations
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>As I mentioned, if you prefer to install it somewhere else, we can by explicitly stating the location of where
                it should be built. And if that location is not in your $PATH, we will need to add it later on.</p>

            <pre>
    <code>
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/.local/ --enable-optimizations
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>
                <code>./configure</code> does some checking before the software is installed. If all the checks pass it will create a makefile. It
                can be called without any parameters. You can also call ./configure --help to find what other options can
                be passed to it. Since Debian already comes with two versions of Python, we need to tell the configuration
                script not to overwrite the systems primary python executable. </p>

            <p>
                While
                <code>--enable-optimization</code> will give you an
                <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/README.rst#build-instructions">optimized build</a> of python Whatever that means.
            </p>

            <p>Regarding where you should install it, well, that is up to you. It is your personal system but allow me to give
                you a brief overview.
                <code>/usr/bin</code> is for distribution-managed normal user programs.
                <code>/usr/local/bin</code> is for normal user programs not managed by the distribution package manager, e.g. locally compiled packages.
                You should not install them into
                <code>/usr/bin</code> because future distribution upgrades may modify or delete them without warning. And here is a
                <a href="http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/busybox/2010-December/074114.html">bit of history</a> how all this came about.</p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a> is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source
                code. If we were to ask the man pages regarding what options we can pass along make, we can find out what
                the
                <code>-j</code> option stands for.</p>

            <pre>
    <code>
    -j [jobs], --jobs[=jobs]
        Specifies  the  number of jobs (commands) to run simultaneously.  If there
        is more than one -j option, the last one is effective.  If the  -j  option
        is  given without an argument, make will not limit the number of jobs that
        can run simultaneously.
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>You can read more about how it is implemented
                <a href="http://make.mad-scientist.net/papers/jobserver-implementation/">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>The option passed into the make command will utilize up to 2 CPU cores. You can adjust the number passed into
                the
                <code>-j</code> flag to match the
                <a href="https://devguide.python.org/setup/#unix">number of cores</a> you have on your machine.
            </p>

            <pre>
    <code>
    make -j2
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Up to this make command is all we need to have a working interpreter that can be run in place. The directory
                where python was built:
                <code>./python</code>
            </p>

            <p>In case you are wondering how the python interpreter was started by executing
                <code>./python</code>, an important concept, which eludes me at times, is that in Linux
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file">everything is a file</a>. In this case, that file in particular is an executable file which will invoke Python.</p>

            <p>At this point we run altinstall which will avoid overwriting the systems python binary as opposed to the other
                command I won't even mention. Finally you can run your new version of python by calling it along with its
                version number.</p>


            <pre>
    <code>
    sudo make altinstall
    python3.6</code>
    </pre>

            <p>To recap all the commands for a working built installed in
                <code>/usr/local</code>:</p>

            <pre>
    <code>
    sudo apt-get build-dep python3.4
    ./configure --enable-optimizations
    make -s -j2
    sudo make altinstall
    </code>
    </pre>

            <p>If you decide to change the location and that location is not found in
                <code>$PATH</code> as in the following example, you'll need to add it to your
                <code>$PATH</code>
            </p>

            <pre>
    <code>
    sudo apt-get build-dep python3.4
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local/ --enable-optimizations
    make -s -j2
    make altinstall
    </code>
    </pre>

            <p>Since we specified a different directory, we need to explicitly add the new installation to the
                <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14638025/8828479">path</a> in .bashrc file since the prefix is
                <code>.local export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin</code>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> There is one caveat. The
                <code>build-dep</code> may not add all the required dependencies. That will depend if there are any new development headers. When
                you run
                <code>make</code> it will say if there are any that are missing.</p>
