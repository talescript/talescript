<h2>Design basics</h2>
<p>Focus on mobile first. Designing with limited space means that you need to think about pages and interactions on a phone. By starting with the harder problem first, which is making something usable on a tiny screen, you then adopt a solution to the easier problem, the big screen.</p>
<p>Similarly, design with black and white first.</p>
<p>This constraint forces you to focus on spacing and laying out elements. Making it beautiful and usable in every way. Black and white forces you to focus on things like spacing, sizes, and layout first.</p>
<p>Adding one color to a grayscale site draws the eye easily.</p>
<h2>Double your whitespace</h2>
<p>If you want to make UI that looks designed, add a lot of breathing room.
Add whitespace between text, elements and groups of elements.
If you design from a blank canvas, you are adding in elements, with whitespace at the front.</p>
<h2>Text on images</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add an overlay on every image</li>
<li>Text-in-a-box</li>
<li>Blur the image / blur part of the underlying image</li>
</ul>
<h2>Make text pop</h2>
<p>If a site element needs emphasis, apply both up-pop and down-pop styles.</p>
<h2>Fonts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Work Sans</li>
<li>Roboto</li>
<li>Montserrat</li>
<li>Source Sans Pro / Source Serif or Source Code Pro</li>
