# Talescript

It's somewhat difficult to describe your pet project. This project went through several iterations and will continue going through a few more.

It is a side project which allowed me to practice and learn all the different aspects of starting a business. It is quite hard if you haven't guessed that yet.

By doing this, I'm forced to make my own decisions. Everything from design, to what code to write and even copy editing. Color theory; something I have as of yet looked into aside from a few wayward glances, image optimizations, CSS animations and transitions, layout and so on and on and on.

Despite that this project goes beyond just **FRONT END DEVELOPMENT**, it has and is currently helping me get a better understanding of everything that is involved.
